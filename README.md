================

A simple test Angular app that searches Twitter, completed as a learning exercise.
There is a simple Python server to handle the Twitter requests, as the Twitter
API does not support CORS requests.

I probably won't be making and changes to this. Also, note that the Twitter consumer key & secret have been revoked.
